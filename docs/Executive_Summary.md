## Historical Insights

- Revenue grew approximately 8–9% year-over-year across the two most recent reporting periods, driven by stable member demand and renewal strength
- Sequential movement in revenue was seasonal rather than structural
- Operating income expanded faster than revenue year-over-year, indicating operating leverage
- Margins remained stable with a consistent spread between gross and operating margin, reflecting disciplined cost control

## Scenario Results (Full-Year)

| Scenario | Revenue | Operating Income |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| Base | **$318B** | **$11.1B** |
