# Executive Summary — Costco FP&A Analysis

This project evaluates Costco’s recent financial performance using public SEC filings and builds a driver-based forecast with Base, Upside, and Downside scenarios.

---

## Historical Insights

- Revenue grew approximately 8–9% year-over-year across the two most recent reporting periods, driven by stable member demand and renewal strength
- Sequential movement in revenue was seasonal rather than structural
- Operating income expanded faster than revenue year-over-year, indicating operating leverage
- Margins remained stable with a consistent spread between gross and operating margin, reflecting disciplined cost control

## Forecast Methodology

Revenue is modeled using two fundamental FP&A drivers:
Revenue = Membership Growth × Spend per Member

Base Case Assumptions  
- Membership growth: **7%**  
- Spend per member growth: **3%**  
- Operating margin: **3.5%**

Upside Case  
- Membership growth: **9%**  
- Spend per member growth: **5%**  
- Operating margin: **4.0%**

Downside Case  
- Membership growth: **4%**  
- Spend per member growth: **1%**  
- Operating margin: **3.0%**

## Scenario Results (Full-Year)

| Scenario | Revenue | Operating Income |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| Base | **$318B** | **$11.1B** |
| Upside | $351B | $14.1B |
| Downside | $281B | $8.4B |

**Conclusion:** Costco shows resilient demand and clear upside sensitivity to membership growth and cost leverage. Even in a weaker environment, profitability remains positive, though pressured by slower renewals and lower margin.
